# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub. I will use it to organize a my first project. It contains folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ basically anything my first project needs. 

I am a creative who likes to learn new things. I am passionate about storytelling, fascinated by human connection, and love puns.
